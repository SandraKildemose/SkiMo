# SkiMo  
Secure Game Asset Platform (Demo Only)
SkiMo is a dual platform built for developers and the gaming community.

**SkiMo Genesisâ„¢**  
AI-powered asset generator for developers.  
Currently generates stylized handgun models â€“ future updates will include terrain, props, and UI assets ready for Unity, Unreal and Godot.

**SkiMo Shieldâ„¢**  
Security tool for modders and traders.  
Scans zipped mods and skins for malware (YARA/ClamAV) and verifies CS:GO skin authenticity via Steam API. Includes secure middleman model for safe trading.

Originally developed as my bachelor project at Epitech Paris, SkiMo explores the intersection of AI creativity and file safety in modern game workflows.
